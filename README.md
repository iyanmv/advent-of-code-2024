# Advent of Code 2024

These are my solutions for the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024) challenges.

## Repository structure

Each day has its own directory in `solutions`. For each day there are two scripts, `part1.py` and `part2.py`, as well as the provided input.

The examples given in both parts are included as unit tests. In some cases I may include additional tests.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo
2. To get the solution: `python solutions/day<XY>/part<Z>.py`
3. To run the unit tests: `python -m unittest tests/test_day<XY>.py`
